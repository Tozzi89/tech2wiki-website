# Why a Tech 2 Wiki?

![](/content/tech_2/tech_2_logo_anim.gif)

The goal of this wiki is to provide documentation based on real life experience with the Tech 2 device and the Techline computer. This means that every action should be easily reproducible using the hardware and software as documented.

The aim is to have an audience ranging from beginner \(n00b\), subject matter expert \(pro\) to all-round specialist \(genius\). We welcome everyone whom has experience and possibly own a Tech 2 to help us to document the Tech 2 functions and features.

Please join the [TECH2WIKI.COM team on GitHub]({{ site.repo }}) and our [Facebook group – Tech 2 Owners’ club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Tech2OwnersClub/) for sharing our knowledge.
