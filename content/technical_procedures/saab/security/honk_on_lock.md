# Honk on lock

## Activate honk-confirmation on lock (Saab 9-5, Saab 9-3 -2003)

It’s possible to get a confirmation from the car that the car is successfully locked/alarmed. When this function is activated the car will honk the horn when you press the lock button twice. When you press the lock button twice the car will enter a mode called TSL (Theft Security Lock), this makes it impossible to open the car from the inside. When you only press the lock button once it’s still possible to open the doors from the inside. This function is programmed in the TWICE module.

### Requirements
