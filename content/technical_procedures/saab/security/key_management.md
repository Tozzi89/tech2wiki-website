# Key management

## Adding a key (Saab 9-3 2003-)

If you have a Saab 9-3 with model year 2003- or newer and only have one key fob it’s a really good idea to invest in an extra key fob as soon as possible. If you loose both of your keys you will have to replace the CIM unit and the locking cylinders. If you buy a key fob that is programmed to another car you will not be able to program it.

### Requirements

- SAAB 9-3 MY03- or newer
- At least one working key fob
- A new/cleared key fob
- Tech2 with CANDi module
- Security Access
- SAAB 1XX.000 PCMCIA card

### Preparations

You will need to have all the keys that you want to function with your car present when you add a new key fob.

To activate this function you will need security access which can be downloaded from TIS (TIS2000 or GlobalTIS).

### Procedure

- Select `F0`: Diagnostics
- Select Model Year
- Select `Saab 9-3 Sport (9440)`
- Select `F4`: All
- Select `F7`: Add/Remove
- Select `F2`: Add Keys
- Press `Enter` when the info about security access and that you’ll need all keys present accurs (If you haven’t downloaded security access from TIS yet, the Tech2 will prompt you to do).
- Turn the ignition key to LOCK position when the Tech2 prompts you to do so.
- Remove the ignition key when the Tech2 prompts you to.

- Remove the ignition key when the Tech2 prompts you to.
- Insert the key fob you wish to program/add.
- Press `OK`
- Press `No` when the Tech2 asks you again if you want to add another key when you have programmed all the key fobs you want functioning with your car. If you want to add more keys you press Yes.
- Remove the ignition key when the Tech2 prompts you to.
- Insert the key again when the Tech2 prompts you to.
