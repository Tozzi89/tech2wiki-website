# Foglights

## Adding Fog Lights (Saab 9-3 2003-)

If you have a Saab 9-3 with model year 2003 or newer and don’t have front fog lighs, this can be retrofitted. The function must be activated with Tech2 after the fog light kit is installed.

## Requirements

- SAAB 9-3 MY03-
- SAAB Fog Light Kit (OEM 12787092 / 32026003)
- Tech2 with CANDi module
- Security Access
- SAAB 1XX.000 PCMCIA card

## Preparations

Install the Fog Lights Kit (Installation instructions MY03-07, Installation instructions MY08-), also make sure that you replace the headlight switch to a version with a button for front fog lights if you don’t have this already.

Note: The headlight switch is not the same for cars with Xenon headlights and cars with Halogen headlights.

To activate this function you will need security access which can be downloaded from TIS (TIS2000 or GlobalTIS).

## Procedure

- Select `F0`: Diagnostics
- Select Model Year
- Select `Saab 9-3 Sport (9440)`
- Select `F4`: All
- Select `F7`: Add/Remove
- Select `F3`: Accessories
- Select `Fog Lights`
- Select `Add` (If you haven’t downloaded security access from TIS yet, the Tech2 will prompt you to do)
- Exit out of the Tech2, cycle the key OFF and back ON and the function should now be enabled.
