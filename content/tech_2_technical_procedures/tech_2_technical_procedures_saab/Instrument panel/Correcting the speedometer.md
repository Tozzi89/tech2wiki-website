# Correcting the speedometer

On the OG9-3 (1998-2002+2003CV) and 9-5 (1998-2010) the Tech-2 can program the Main Instrument Unit (MIU) with various tire sizes, so the speedometer is pretty close to right.

* Tech2 (CANDi module for Saab 9-5 MY06 and newer)
* SAAB 1XX.000 PCMCIA card

## Preparations

    Gather information of which tire size you are using.
