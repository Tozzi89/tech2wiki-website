# Writing PCMCIA using GlobalTIS

GlobalTIS is a computer-based system used for reprogramming software as well as troubleshouting and diagnostics on vehicle control units. GlobalTIS is used through your web browser and requires a compatible version of Java to be able to work correctly. The system requires a hand-held, programmable diagnostic tool, Tech2, in order to communicate with the vehicle.

GlobalTIS can be used to download new software to your PCMCIA card used in the Tech2, the process takes around 15 minutes for a 32MB card.

## Requirements

*   Tech2
*   12V DC adapter as power source for the Tech2
*   PCMCIA card inserted to Tech2
*   COM port, this can be a physical DB9 or a USB to Serial cable, on a desktop/laptop computer.
*   Microsoft Windows
*   Java
*   GlobalTIS

## Preparations

Install GlobalTIS and make sure that your Tech2 can communicate with your computer.

## Writing a PCMCIA card

Make sure that your Tech2 is connected to a reliable power source.

Connect your Tech2 with a serial cable to a serial port on your computer.

Power up the Tech2 and wait for it to boot to the welcome screen.

Start GlobalTIS.

On the start screen/homepage of GlobalTIS, click on `Software Download (SWDL)`.
