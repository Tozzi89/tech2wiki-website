# Default folders

In order to have Tech2Win working correctly the need to match the configuration files to the .bin files location.

After a default installation of the Tech2Win software, the Tech2Win expects;

* configuration files to reside in `C:\Users\Public\General Motors\Tech2Win\config\`
* .bin-files to reside in `C:\Users\Public\General Motors\Tech2Win\pcmcia\`
