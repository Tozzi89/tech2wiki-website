# Branching strategy

Using a branching strategy allows us to collaborate more easily. Each branch can a specific purpose or you can use a named branch, for example 'tech2win' or 'tech2-buyers-guide'.

## Creating a branch

When creating a feature branch using a descriptive name, i.e. `update-todo-list`, as this makes more sense to others too.

## Make changes

Commit your changes to your local branch on a regular interval while working with the files. At the end of your _shift_ make sure that the changes are pushed to the remote repository in your branch. In this case others are aware of your changes and data loss is prevented.

## Pull request

A pull request can be created when your package of commits result in a product increase, in other words; a complete set of files that can be consumed by our target audience.

## Clean up the branches

After the pull request is accepted your branch will be removed from the online repository. Make sure that you remove your local branches too.
