# Structure of the articles

For a logical overview of the articles a structure needs to be defined.

## File and folder structure
* folder_named_as_topic
    * README.md
    * first_topic.md

Folder and filenames are set in lowercase except for the README.md.

## README.md

This file describes the content of the folder and first \# in the article denotes the header in the actual menu.

## Sorting

Sorting is based on the `sort:x` (where `x` is the index number) paragraph at the top of the .md files. The lowest value is set to 100 with a default increase of 100, allowing allows insertion of articles easily without necessarily changing the complete numbering of the topics.

## Search functionality

Creating seperate .MD per topic results in a better search result as this is based on the .md files.
