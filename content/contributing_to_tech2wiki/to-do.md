# To-do list

This file describes the activities which need to done to move the content from the old [DokuWiki website](https://tech2wiki.com/obsolete/doku.php) and the current [Wordpress website](https://tech2wiki.com/) into the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/berrydejager/tech2wiki.com/) in a markdown format, see [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Both the DokuWiki and the Wordpress content need to be evaluated for migration to the 'main' branch of the [Tech2wiki.com GitHub repository](https://github.com/berrydejager/tech2wiki.com/).

For the GitHub repository markdown files are used. The end result will be a GitHub/Pages-hosted webpage running on the tech2wiki.com domain.

## Article backlog

The article backlog is used to make sure that all content is converted from DokuWiki and Wordpress to markdown files on the Github repository.
